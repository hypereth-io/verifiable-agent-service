### Notes:
# - Tests use unmatchable orders (2x market price) for safety
# - Immediate cancellation prevents accidental execution
# - Real private key should be provided in tests/.env (not committed)
# - Both direct and proxy should behave identically
# - Response structure comparison, not exact value comparison
